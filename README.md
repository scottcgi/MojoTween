## MojoUnity-Tween v1.0

MojoUnity-Tween is an amazing Tween animation engine, extremely optimized for `C#` and `Unity`, coded with the new technologies such as `Burst`, `Jobs`, `Collections`, `Mathematics` and more.

The engine provides a complete set of solutions for applying Tween to all aspects of `Unity Objects`, as well as visualizing the running details of Tweens through the `Editor UI`.

The implementation code is concise, clear and easy to understand, has detailed commentsï¼Œuses `#region` for organization, and easy to customize and extend.

The package has rich code samples and detailed usage docs.

## Features

#### Ease Functions:

* Support fully standard `easeInOut` effects.
* Support extra effects such as `Smooth`, `ShakeXYZ`, `BezierQuadraticXYZ`, `BezierCubicXYZ` and more.
* Optimize all functions based on `Burst` and `Mathematics` APIs.
* Use expression expansion whenever possible to optimize functions.

#### Animate Everything:

* `Transform` can perform Tweens with `Move`, `Scale`, `Rotate`, `Shake Position / Scale / Rotation`, `Bezier Quadratic / Cubic Move`.
* `RectTransform` can perform Tweens with `Anchored`, `OffsetMax`, `OffsetMin`, `sizeDelta`.
* `Graphic` can perform Tweens with `Fade`, `Color`, `RGB`.
* `CanvasGroup` can perform Tweens with `Fade`.
* `SpriteRenderer` can perform Tweens with `Fade`.
* `AudioSource` can perform Tweens with `Volume`.
* `Material` can perform Tweens with `Float`, `Int`, `Vector`, `Color`.

#### Tween Control Methods:

* Support queued and concurrent actions in one Tween with `Append`, `AppendInterval`, `AppendCallback`, `AppendIntervalCallback`, `Add`, `AddWithDelay`, `AddDelayCallback`, `AddAfterAppend` and more.
* Support Tween `Play`, `Rewind`, `Restart`, `GotoStart`, `Reverse`, `Stop`, `Pause` and more.
* Support rich Tween state test with `IsPlaying`, `IsRewinding`, `IsPaused`, `IsStopped`, `IsCompleted`, `IsRecycled` and more.
* Support various Tween callback bindings with `SetOnStart`, `SetOnComplete`, `SetOnStop`, `SetOnRecycle` and more.
* Support Tween default ease and relative settings.
* Support chained calls to set properties.

#### Tween Action Control Methods:

* Support ease action with `Float`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`.
* Support independent callback with `SetOnStart`, `SetOnComplete`.
* Support ease and relative for each action value with `SetRelativeAt`, `SetEaseAt`.
* Support custom params with `SetExtraParams`.
* Support chained calls to set properties.

#### Tween Manager Control Methods:

* Support updating Tweens `StopAll`, `RestartAll`, `ReverseAll`, `RewindAll`, `PauseAll`, `TogglePauseAll`, `RecycleAll` and more.
* Support native data release.

#### Performance & Cache:

* All Tweens will be cached and reused, no need to manually manage the memory data.
* All Tween actions have independent cache-reuse.
* All values of all actions are cached by `NativeList` and used by `Jobs`.
* All ease functions and action values settings are optimized with `BurstCompile` and `Unsafe Code` and `Mathematics` APIs.

#### Tween Runtime Info:

* Integrate an Editor extension to easily and quickly extend the `Inspector` and `Window`.
* All Tweens runtime info can be visited through the `Editor UI`.

#### Customize & Extend:

* The engine code is highly cohesive and low coupling, with clear hierarchy and easy to expand.
* Many engine public APIs are implemented based on the extension of the core code, so it is very natural and smooth to customize your own function extensions with the core code.
* All engine extensions use `C# (static this) Extension Methods`, which makes it convenient and fast to use.
